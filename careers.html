			Working with COMPANY NAME is a fascinating and rewarding experience although it doesn't pay shit. Most of our employees are interns and move on from the company after about 3-4 business days. In fact, a lot of them are actually living in remote places in the world such as Cambodia, or Laos. We definitely would not reccommend working for us if you want to make money. However, if this is not your desire, by all means please use the form below to get in touch and we will review your application. You will be accepted immediately as no one wants to help us with our cause. Thanks for your consideration, have a nice day.
